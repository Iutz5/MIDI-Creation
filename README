MIDI Assignment
Oct 5th 2020

I did not work with a buddy for this assignment

I only spent an hour doing the basic part of the assignment, and had so much fun
with it that I continued for the next couple of hours trying to implement my own
things and varieties in the code!

I loved this assignment! I want to work more on it and extend it with further
knowledge sometime in the future and read over the Georgia Tech Lib that you sent
me to see what all I can do with this assingment

No other concerns for me!
